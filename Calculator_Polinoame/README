This Java code constitutes a basic polynomial operations calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI).

Polynomial Operations (org.example.Operation):
The Operations class contains methods for polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration.
Each operation takes two polynomial inputs (Polinom objects) and returns the result as a Polinom object.
The implementation includes handling edge cases like division by zero and maintaining the order of terms in the polynomials.

Polynomial Representation (org.example.Polynmial):
Monom represents a single term in a polynomial, storing its coefficient and power.
Polinom represents a polynomial as a collection of monomials. It uses a TreeMap to ensure that monomials are ordered by their power.
It provides methods for adding monomials, getting the degree of the polynomial, retrieving the maximum monomial, and converting the polynomial to a string.

Graphical User Interface (org.example.GUI):
The GUI is built using Swing components.
View class extends JFrame and sets up the main window for the application. It contains labels, text fields, and buttons for input and output.
The Controller class acts as the event handler for the GUI components. It processes user actions such as button clicks and delegates the corresponding polynomial operations to the Operations class.
parseMonom and parsePolinom functions are utility methods to parse user input strings into polynomial objects.

Main Application Entry Point:
The main application entry point creates an instance of the View class, initializing the GUI and starting the application.

Overall, this code provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic polynomial operations, making it easier for users to manipulate polynomials without needing to understand the underlying mathematical operations.
