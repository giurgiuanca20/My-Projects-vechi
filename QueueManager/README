This Java code is a simulation of a queuing system. Below is a description of each component and its functionality:

Main class (Main.java):
Reads input parameters such as time limit, maximum and minimum service times, maximum and minimum arrival times, number of queues, and number of clients.
Creates a SimulationManager instance with the provided parameters and starts a new thread to run the simulation.

SimulationManager class (SimulationManager.java):
Manages the overall simulation process.
Initializes a RandomGenerator to generate clients with random arrival and service times.
Creates a Scheduler instance and sets the scheduling strategy.
Runs the simulation loop until the time limit is reached.
Manages the arrival and departure of clients, updates statistics, and writes output to a file.

Scheduler class (Scheduler.java):
Manages multiple queues.
Allows changing the scheduling strategy.
Dispatches clients to the appropriate queue based on the selected strategy.

ConcreteStrategyTime class (ConcreteStrategyTime.java):
Implements a scheduling strategy where clients are added to the queue with the shortest waiting time.

QueueClass class (QueueClass.java):
Represents a queue in the system.
Runs as a separate thread.
Keeps track of clients in the queue, their waiting times, and handles client removal.
Provides methods to add, remove, and get clients from the queue.

Client class (Client.java):
Represents a client in the simulation with an ID, arrival time, and service time.

RandomGenerator class (RandomGenerator.java):
Generates a specified number of clients with random arrival and service times.

FileWriting class (FileWriting.java):
Handles writing output to a file.

Overall, this code simulates a queuing system where clients arrive, wait in queues, receive service, and depart. It allows for different scheduling strategies and provides statistical analysis of the simulation results.
